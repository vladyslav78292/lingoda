      <section>
        <ol>
          <li>Company History and Founding: Lingoda was founded in 2013 by Felix Weth and 
            Fabian Wunderlich in Berlin, Germany. The founders aimed to create a platform that 
            would offer convenient and effective language learning opportunities to individuals 
            around the world.</li>
          <li>Language Offerings: Lingoda specializes in providing language courses in multiple 
            languages, catering to learners of all levels, from beginners to advanced speakers. 
            Some of the popular languages offered on the platform include English, German, 
            Spanish, French, and Business English. The course selection may vary based on 
            demand and availability.</li>
          <li>Live Online Classes: The core of Lingoda's services is live online classes conducted 
            by qualified native-speaking teachers. These classes provide learners with the 
            opportunity to interact with teachers and other students in real-time, fostering a dynamic
            and immersive language learning experience. The live nature of the classes allows for 
            immediate feedback and personalized attention to each learner's progress</li>
          <li>Flexibility and Convenience: Lingoda is known for its flexible scheduling options, 
            offering learners the ability to choose from various time slots to fit their busy lifestyles 
            and time zones. This convenience enables students to integrate language learning into 
            their daily routines without major disruptions</li>
            <li>Group Classes and Private Lessons: Lingoda offers both group classes and private 
              one-on-one lessons. Group classes allow learners to engage with peers at similar 
              proficiency levels and participate in collaborative learning. Private lessons, on the other 
              hand, provide personalized attention and the opportunity to focus on specific language 
              skills or topics.</li>
            <li>CEFR-Aligned Curriculum: Lingoda's courses are structured according to the 
              Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), a widely 
              recognized standard for language proficiency levels. This alignment ensures that 
              learners receive a comprehensive and systematic approach to language learning.</li>
            <li>Language Challenges and Certificates: Lingoda occasionally organizes language 
              challenges, encouraging learners to attend classes regularly for a set period. Successful
              completion of these challenges may lead to partial or full refunds as an incentive for 
              committed learners. Additionally, upon finishing a course, learners have the option to 
              receive Lingoda certificates, which verify their language proficiency level.</li>
            <li>Learning Materials and Resources: Lingoda's platform provides learners with access 
              to a variety of learning materials and resources to complement their online classes. 
              These resources may include interactive exercises, grammar guides, vocabulary lists, 
              and multimedia content to reinforce language skills.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Please note that as time passes, companies like Lingoda may continue to evolve, 
          expand their services, or make changes to their offerings. Therefore, I recommend 
          visiting Lingoda's official website or conducting a recent search to get the most current 
          and accurate information about the company and its services.</p>
